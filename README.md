    Carpenter simulator is an Unreal Engine 4 test project made by TeamHOLO. The project was designed for Ventspils IT Challenge participation and made it through to the finals. Although it didn't take a trophy it's a great example of how to quickly learn game development basics using UE4 and help games bring students closer to knowledge.
